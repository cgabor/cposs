TODO

- Discounts based from database
	- Support price differences depending on shop (how do you print barcodes for this!?) - Should these be classed as discounts?
	- Multi buy discounts
	- Reduction discounts (by % or monetary value)
	
- Print Vouchers or use pre-printed vochers (or both), pre-printed need credit adding to them like top-up cards
- Enter weather information
- Get weather forecast information from internet
- Get currency/exchange rates from interent
- Support multiple currency
- Stock take
- Stock transfer
- Login screen
- Copy all information from the website for mulimedia screen(s) in shop (maybe this should be a seperate application)
- Settings screen
	- Address of website (somehow figure out addressing system too so that we can pull up the correct page for product information)
	- Automatically add to basket on scan instead of showing details first option 
	- Change barcode reader signout ASCII
- Second screen showing customer display
	- Show the website when a product is added if using a monitor
- Add a widget allowing changing of quantity to add to basket (press before you scan)
- Money counting function

- Customer registration and logging of sales
- Ability to review printed reciepts
- WHEN INPUTING MONEY BRING UP A SCREEN TO COUNT WHICH COINS/NOTES (THIS WOULD ALLOW EXACT COIN/NOTE TRACKING) * this should be optional
- Restore previously completed sales (why?)
- UPDATING facility


Low priority (but should be considered in current development)
- Add translations
- Weight of item (i.e quantity should be a floating point)?
- Add a setting for Pre-string to table names in database (i.e. cposs_products , *_products)

UNLIKELY ADDITIONS
- Credit card processing
